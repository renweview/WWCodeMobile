Let’s wrap up the series with some hands on the skills we learned!

 We will meet on 4th August at 11:30 am ET to discuss our learnings. Sign up for the session here: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUsfuqhrD8sGt2eqUqgnvA7hZTr7suRAIog#/registration

You can share your project solutions inside this folder or share links to your Github projects.

Using the api from https://sunrise-sunset.org/api and https://github.com/AsyncSwift/AsyncLocationKit, write a simple swiftui app that detects your current location and shows the sunset and sunrise times. 
You would use async/await for all the networking call for the api and use the AsyncLocationKit to using async/await for getting the permission and location.
Take a good look of async and await is also implemented in https://github.com/AsyncSwift/AsyncLocationKit

🤔While working on this project, do reflect on aspects such as:
best practises - Did you notice any code smells like nesting of subscriptions or readability challenges.✅
your debugging experience 🔬
How much of the project did you convert to Combine - do you feel the entire project could be reactive, would it be an overuse or does it help? 💭
what were some learnings you had - example - forgetting to switch to the main thread on subscribe📝
or anything else - feel free to share some other concerns we ought to consider 🙋🏽‍♀️
🗣️We can then discuss these in our next session! 👩🏻‍🏫
