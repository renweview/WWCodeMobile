# Dynamic Programming

<br>Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic technique for solving an optimization problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to its subproblems. <br>It is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. <br>The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. <br>This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.
