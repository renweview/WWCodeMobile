<h3> Week 1: Big O Complexity Analysis/ Review Data types and Structures </h3>


For January, we go over Big O complexity and review our basic data types and structures in our language of choice. Be familiar with the basics of your language!
Big O notation is one of the most fundamental tools for computer scientists to analyze the cost of an algorithm. It describes the complexity of your code using algebraic terms in terms of time and space. Basically in simple terms, it describes the complexity of an algorithm as input increases.
We use big-O notation for asymptotic upper bounds, since it bounds the growth of the running time from above for large enough input sizes.
What you need to know:
1) What is Big O?
2) Complexity of common algorithms
3) How to calculate it
4) Trade off between time vs space complexity

Problems Week 1: What is the worst-case complexity of the each of the following code fragments?


1. Two loops in a row:
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    sequence of statements
}
for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
    sequence of statements
}

2. How would the complexity change if the second loop went to N instead of M?
A nested loop followed by a non-nested loop:

for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        sequence of statements
    }
}

for (k = 0; k < N; k++) {
    sequence of statements
}


3. A nested loop in which the number of times the inner loop executes depends on the value of the outer loop index:
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (j = N; j > i; j--) {
        sequence of statements
    }
}

### Problems Week 2

1. Put these functions in order of increasing growth rates:
(1.5)^n,n^100,(logn)^3,âˆšnlogn,10^n,(n!)^2,n^99+n^98,101^16
2. What is the time complexity of searching an element given its index in an array?
3) What is the time complexity of merge sort?

### Week 4

What is the time, space complexity of the following code: 
1.
int a = 0, b = 0;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    a = a + rand();
}
for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
    b = b + rand();
}
2.
int a = 0;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (j = N; j > i; j--) {
        a = a + i + j;
    }
}
3.
int i, j, k = 0;
for (i = n / 2; i <= n; i++) {
    for (j = 2; j <= n; j = j * 2) {
        k = k + n / 2;
    }
}

- O(N + M) time, O(1) space,O(N*N), O(nLogn)
