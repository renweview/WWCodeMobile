# Graph


In computer science, a graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.

<p> The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. 
  <br> More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). <br>
  The graph is denoted by G(E, V).</p>
