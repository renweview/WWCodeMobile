# February: Arrays/Strings

Our second month is about Arrays and Strings. 
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations where each element is identified by its index. 
A string is very similar to an array. 
A string is a collection of characters and depending on your coding language, it could also be identified using index. 
Both, arrays and strings can be mutable or immutable. Because they are both very similar, Algorithms problems tend to be solved in similar ways too.

What you should know?
-What is an array? What is a String?
-Implementation and how it works under the hood
-Delete/remove, add/append, insert and other manipulation functions and their time complexities
-When to use an array/When to use a string 
-Trade off of using array or strings
